Hi, I'm Zarif! I have a technical background and hold a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Micro data analysis from Dalarna University, with a major in Business Intelliegence. I have 5 years of experience in the field of information technology, where I held roles such as Data Analyst/BI specialist, Head of Department, and CTO in a technological startup. After a year of transitioning from software engineer to Data Analysis, I am currently a Data Analyst at a E-commerce company Tech Diversity, starting from Mar 2022.
